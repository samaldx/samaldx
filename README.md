### Hello there friends ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**samaldx/samaldx** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm currently teaching myself web development
with a bit of help from [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
and a little bit of Python on the side.
I have a weakness for Linux and JRPGs from the 90s/00s
My pronouns are They/Them
